## Tesla Stock Forecast & Risk Dashboard

## Overview

This project builds an end-to-end data analytics pipeline to analyze and forecast Tesla (TSLA) stock performance and short-term market risk. Using Python, SQL, and Tableau, it integrates data extraction, time series modeling, and visualization to communicate both expected returns and volatility in a clear and intuitive way.

The goal is to show how quantitative forecasting and risk metrics can be turned into insights that help non-technical audiences understand market behavior and uncertainty.

## Objectives

Forecast Tesla’s short-term returns using ARIMA, and evaluate performance against major indices like SPY and QQQ.

Model volatility using GARCH.

Compare Tesla’s performance and risk profile to other large-cap tech stocks like AAPL, NVDA, and MSFT.

Visualize forecasts, confidence intervals, and volatility patterns through interactive Tableau dashboards.

## Tools and Technologies
Python (pandas, statsmodels, arch, yfinance): Data collection, feature engineering, and modeling
SQL (PostgreSQL or SQLite): Relational data storage and querying
Tableau: Interactive visualization and storytelling
GitHub: Version control and project documentation
